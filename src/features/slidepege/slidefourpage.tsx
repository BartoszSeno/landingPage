              The Drakensberg is the highest mountain range in Southern Africa.
              The name is derived from the dutch and means “dragons mountain”.
              The Amphitheatre is over 5 kilometers (3 miles) in length and has
              precipitous cliffs rising approximately 1200 meters (4000 ft)
              along its entire length.

              is only a million years old, and formed after the Pacific tectonic
              plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot. A huge plume of liquid
              magma welled up from deep inside Earth forming Mauna Kea as it
              cooled. Despite this, the volcano has stayed dormant for a long
              time now, having last erupted 46,000 years ago.
