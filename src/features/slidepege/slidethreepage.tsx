              Mt. Everest, at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level,
              undeniably claims the point of highest altitude in the world. The
              title of “tallest mountain in the word”, however, as measured from
              the base to its peak, belongs to Mauna Kea which has an altitude
              of only 4,205 meters (13,796 feet) above sea level.
